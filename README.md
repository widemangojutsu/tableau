# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Explore relationships with CPI and housing price

## Process
Look at data with excell, look at over view
used tableau for visualization and exploratory

## Results
I used the first with CPI and housing. I found that cpi and housing have no direct relation, low pvalue, however looking further
in the financial crashes found in the data, there are some more points to explore such as money supply increase from money stimulus as reaction of crisis response

## Challenges 
Getting the right types of data for tableau to work

## Future Goals
explore the stimulus area
